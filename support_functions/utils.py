    """
    Given a string of characters which may contain accents or other unicode characters, first tries to replace accents
    e.g. "caf√©" becomes "cafe"

    Then strips all non-ascii characters remaining.
    e.g.  "<Simplified Chinese Text>" becomes ""

    This is useful for writing say, customer names, to VMWAre when they could be accented or contain non-latin
    characters, because vSphere will happily accept those characters, then turn into a dribbling mess later when
    handling them...
